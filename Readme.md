### I Learnt to create full length beatiful web page called **Developers Landing Page** template. HTML, CSS, CSS Selector, Flexbox, Positions and SVGs are the main concepts of the project I covered in this project. I also learn't how to push my code to github, though I know it before but the new thing I learnt to make my Github project Live.
